## Project Overview

The Clinic System is a web-based application developed using JSP, CSS, and deployed on Apache Tomcat, with Java as the backend programming language. The web application is designed to help a psychiatrist manage and record patient data efficiently. The design and functionality are inspired by Dr. Hannibal Lecter, known for his meticulous and mysterious nature, emphasizing precision and thorough data management.

The system aims to provide a simple, user-friendly interface for psychiatrists to track patient information, sessions, and revenue, while maintaining organized records.

## Main Features

The web application consists of three main pages: Dashboard, Patient, and Session.

Dashboard

### The Dashboard serves as the central overview for the psychiatrist. It provides the following features:
- Total Patients: Displays the total number of patients currently managed in the system
- Total Bookings: Shows the total number of session bookings made by all patients
- Total Revenue: Provides an overview of the total income generated
- Monthly Revenue Data: Displays detailed revenue statistics per month for easy tracking and analysis
The dashboard gives the psychiatrist a quick summary of the clinic’s performance and patient activity
